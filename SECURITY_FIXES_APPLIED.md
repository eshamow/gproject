# Security Fixes Applied

## Summary
All critical security vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated. The application now passes all security tests.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CRITICAL
**Issue**: User input was stored and displayed without proper sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be executed.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `sanitizeInput()` function that HTML-escapes all user input
- All text inputs (title, description, owner, etc.) are now sanitized before storage
- HTML escaping prevents script tags and event handlers from executing
- Added input length validation to prevent buffer issues

**Affected Handlers**:
- `createEpic()` - Now sanitizes title, description, and owner fields
- `updateEpic()` - Sanitizes all user-provided fields
- `createTheme()` - Sanitizes name, description, and quarter fields
- `updateTheme()` - Sanitizes all user-provided fields

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CRITICAL
**Issue**: State-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) could be executed without CSRF token validation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added CSRF token validation to all state-changing operations
- Tokens are validated using the existing `validateCSRFToken()` function
- Requests without valid CSRF tokens return 403 Forbidden

**Protected Endpoints**:
- POST `/api/epics` - Create epic
- PUT `/api/epics/{id}` - Update epic
- DELETE `/api/epics/{id}` - Delete epic
- POST `/api/themes` - Create theme
- PUT `/api/themes/{id}` - Update theme
- DELETE `/api/themes/{id}` - Delete theme

### 3. Broken Access Control - CRITICAL
**Issue**: Users could access and modify other users' epics and themes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `user_id` column to `epics` and `themes` tables
- All queries now filter by the authenticated user's ID
- Update and delete operations verify ownership before allowing changes
- Users can only see and modify their own data

**Database Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE epics ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE themes ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
CREATE INDEX idx_epics_user_id ON epics(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_themes_user_id ON themes(user_id);
```

### 4. Input Validation - HIGH
**Issue**: Insufficient validation of user input could lead to data integrity issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive input validation functions
- Title/Name: Required, max 200 characters
- Description: Max 5000 characters
- Color: Must be valid hex color format (#RRGGBB)
- Status: Must be from allowed values list
- All inputs are trimmed and null bytes removed

**Validation Functions Added**:
- `sanitizeInput()` - Removes dangerous characters and escapes HTML
- `isValidHexColor()` - Validates color format
- `isValidEpicStatus()` - Validates epic status values
- `isValidThemeStatus()` - Validates theme status values

## Security Improvements

### Authentication & Authorization
- All API endpoints now require authentication
- User context is properly validated on each request
- Session-based access control is enforced

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Input validation at application layer
- Database constraints for data integrity
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

## Test Results
All security tests are now passing:
- ✅ `TestEpicAPIRequiresAuthentication` - All endpoints require auth
- ✅ `TestEpicXSSVulnerability` - XSS payloads are properly sanitized
- ✅ `TestEpicCSRFVulnerability` - CSRF tokens are validated

## Files Modified
1. `/cmd/web/main.go` - Updated handlers with security controls
2. Database schema - Added user_id columns and indexes
3. Helper functions - Added input validation and sanitization

## Deployment Requirements
Before deploying to production:
1. Run database migration to add user_id columns
2. Ensure all existing data is properly migrated
3. Update frontend templates to include CSRF tokens in requests
4. Test all user flows with the new security controls

## Security Best Practices Implemented
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: HTML escaping prevents XSS attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: State-changing operations require valid tokens
- **Secure by Default**: Security controls are mandatory, not optional
