# SSE DEFERRED - Breaking the Debugging Loop

After hours of debugging SSE that works in test pages but not in production, we're making a pragmatic decision:

## Decision: DEFER SSE Implementation

**Why:**
1. SSE is a nice-to-have, not core value
2. We've spent hours debugging without resolution
3. The test pages prove SSE CAN work, but integration is complex
4. We're violating "Ship Weekly" principle

## Current Solution: Simple Auto-Refresh

Instead of SSE, we're using:
1. Meta refresh tag for the whole page during sync
2. Or JavaScript polling every 10 seconds for status
3. This works TODAY with zero complexity

## When to Revisit SSE

Only revisit when:
1. Users explicitly request real-time updates
2. We have shipped all core features
3. We have time to properly debug the integration issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Foundation vs Nice-to-Have**: SSE is nice-to-have, not foundation
2. **Debugging Time Box**: Should have stopped after 1 hour
3. **Pragmatic Shipping**: Simple solution that works > Complex solution in progress
4. **Test in Context**: Working in isolation â‰  working in integration

## The Issues We Found

For future reference when we revisit:
1. SSE works in test pages perfectly
2. Main dashboard has some interaction with base.html that breaks it
3. Possible issues: CSP, authentication, Alpine.js interference
4. The gray "Connecting..." suggests connection starts but never completes

## Simple Alternative Implemented

```javascript
// Poll every 10 seconds
setInterval(() => {
    fetch('/api/sync-status')
        .then(r => r.json())
        .then(data => updateStatus(data));
}, 10000);
```

This is good enough for v1.
